# Can't Stop

Can't Stop is a board game originally release in the early 80's in which players test their luck to try to race up their pieces up the board quickest. The first player to reach the top of three columns wins. This iPhone app takes the rules of this original game and ports it to the phone. People can play against themselves or up to four of their closest friends to see who can master the dice and who just can't stop. This app was developed by Sara McAllister.
